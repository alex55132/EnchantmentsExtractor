# Enchantment Extractor
![Image](EnchantmentsExtractor.png)
Enchantment Extractor is, as its name says, a plugin for extracting enchantment from items.
Swords, Axes, Shovels, Armor... Almost everything that is enchanted can have its enchantments extracted!
## Installation
The instalation couldn't be simpler! Only drag and drop the .jar file to your server /plugins folder.
## Usage
Take the item you want to extract enchantments from, use the command **/disenchant** and make sure to have
diamonds in your inventory, because you will need them to pay the operation!
### How does the extraction work?
The extraction requires diamonds to work, so the plugin calculates how much an extraction costs assuming 
every level of the enchantment cost 1 diamond. So extract Power II from a sword would cost 2 diamonds, Power IV would cost 4 diamonds and so on...

Since **1.2** now you can add custom materials to pay with and you can customize how much do you want your users to pay
for the extracion.

## Support:

Having trouble with the plugin? Found a bug? Have a suggestion? Feel free to open an Issue on this repository so I can add new things to the plugin :)

## Development:
Do you want to extend the plugin functionality? Great! In this section I'll explain how to do it in order to make all the dependencies
work, so let's begin!

The [VaultAPI](https://github.com/MilkBowl/VaultAPI) is used in order to enable the Economy usage. 

VaultAPI and Spigot API is available through Maven (See pom.xml).
