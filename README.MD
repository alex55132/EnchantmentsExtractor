# Enchantment Extractor
![Image](EnchantmentsExtractor.png)
Enchantment Extractor is, as its name says, a plugin for extracting enchantment from items.
Swords, Axes, Shovels, Armor... Almost everything that is enchanted can have its enchantments extracted!
## Installation
The instalation couldn't be simpler! Only drag and drop the .jar file to your server /plugins folder.
## Usage
Take the item you want to extract enchantments from, use the command **/disenchant** and make sure to have
diamonds in your inventory, because you will need them to pay the operation!
### How does the extraction work?
The extraction requires diamonds to work, so the plugin calculates how much an extraction costs assuming 
every level of the enchantment cost 1 diamond. So extract Power II from a sword would cost 2 diamonds, Power IV would cost 4 diamonds and so on...
## Permissions
- enchantmentsextractor.disenchant: Allows the user to use the /disenchant command
## TODO:

- Custom materials payment (Not only diamonds ;))
- ~~Vault integration (For using money instead of materials)~~ Implemented in 1.1 :)
